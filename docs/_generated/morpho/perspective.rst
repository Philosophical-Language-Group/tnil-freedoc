Perspective
-----------

Perspective quantifies both nominal and verbal stems and can provide
tense-like information for verbal stems. This category, like that of of
"Number" in other languages, differentiates between references to one or many
instances of a root, as well as making possible reference to all instances of
the root across space and time, or to the underlying concept of the root
itself. For verbs Perspective works with Aspect and Extension to create
analogues for many of the "Tenses" found in other languages.

TODO provide table of Tense-Aspect-Extension and Tense-Aspect1-Aspect2
combos

There are 4 Perspectives:

- `Monadic`_ - *single instance*
- `Polyadic`_ - *multiple instances*
- `Nomic`_ - *all instances in space and time*
- `Abstract`_ - *idea/concept/essence*
